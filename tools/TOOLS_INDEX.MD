# Tools Index

This file is an ongoing list of the supplementary tools that we are building as we progress with `kaldi`.
 
**When updating this file, do so from `pitchKaldi` branch!**

Below are the subfolders for `tools/`:

- `acous_pre` = scripts used for pre-processing of acoustic files to be used in the model
- `analysis` = scripts used in the analysis of model results
- `lm_pre` = scripts used for pre-processing files to be used in building the language model
- `misc` = doesn't fit anywhere else
- `trans_pre` = scripts used for pre-processing transcript files to be used in training of the model
